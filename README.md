# Hospital-Device-Tender-Margin
This project simulates a real-world MedTech sales analytics pipeline, designed to support strategic decision-making for hospital device tenders. It demonstrates a complete ETL → Data Warehouse → BI Dashboard workflow:
1. Extract messy operational CSV files
2. Transform & clean using SQL (MySQL Workbench)
3. Build dimensional data warehouse (star schema)
4. Prepare data for BI reporting (e.g., Power BI)
5. Create tender profit margin insights for business stakeholders
